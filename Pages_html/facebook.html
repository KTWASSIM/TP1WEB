    "Facebook is an online social media and social networking service owned by Meta Platforms, an American technology
    company.

    Founded in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg, along with Harvard College students Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin
    Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes, the platform's name is derived from the 'face book' directories traditionally used for
    American university students. Initially exclusive to Harvard students, it gradually expanded to encompass other
    North American universities and, since 2006, has been accessible to anyone over 13 years old.

    As of December 2022, Facebook reported 3 billion monthly active users and was ranked as the third most-visited
    website globally. Additionally, it held the distinction of being the most downloaded mobile app of the 2010s."
