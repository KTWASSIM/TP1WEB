  <p>
    WhatsApp, officially known as WhatsApp Messenger, is a freeware, cross-platform, centralized instant messaging (IM)
    and voice-over-IP (VoIP) service owned by the United States tech conglomerate Meta Platforms. It enables users to
    send text, voice, and video messages, make voice and video calls, and share various types of content, including
    images, documents, and user locations. WhatsApp is available on mobile devices and can also be accessed from
    computers. To use the service, users need a mobile phone number for registration. In January 2018, WhatsApp
    introduced a separate business app called WhatsApp Business, which allows communication with the standard WhatsApp
    client.
